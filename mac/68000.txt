68000 compatible software
-------------------------

Some apps and extensions that still work on 68000 macs. In parentheses
notes and RAM requirements. (Compatibility tested mainly on 4MB PB100 or
Plus; System 7.0.1*). Note that also newer versions _might_ work.

System 7.0.1* leaves 3238K free memory on a 4MB PB100 (Extensions off, 32K
Disk Cache); additional MacTCP 2.0.6 and MacPPP 2.0.1 leave 3122K free
memory; System 7.5.5 leaves 2917K free memory (Extensions off, 32K Disk
Cache).

System software
---------------

Q: Given enough memory, what is the best System for 68000 macs?

A: It really depends on what software you want to run and with what System
it is compatible.

System 7.x needs at least (2.5-)4MB RAM. System 7.1 may be the stablest
7.x. There is some stuff that needs 7.5, but little of it runs on a 68000
anyway. Of course, 7.1 is not available for free like 7.0*, 7.0.1*,
7.5.3rev2 and 7.5.5 (which is the last System that runs on 68000 macs).

System 7.5.5 takes a little more memory (2917K vs 3238K free RAM on a 4MB
PB100, Extensions off, 32K Disk Cache) and somewhat more HD space than
7.0.1*.

Of Systems 7.0* vs 7.0.1*, it may be easiest to use 7.0.1* with HD floppy
drives and 7.0* with DD floppy drives (although you can always custom
install from HD floppies on another mac with HD floppy drive). The biggest
gain in 7.0.1* was updated math routines, but this speed gain was not
available to the 68000 anyway. Still, 7.0.1 uses slightly less memory. Both
systems *need* "Tune Up 1.1.1" installed - this is important both for
better memory use and not loosing files! You can confirm that the Tune-Up
is installed by selecting About this Macintosh from the Apple menu - the
bullet (* or more properly €) after System version means that the Tune-Up
is active.

When it comes to speed, 6.x is always a lot faster than 7.x but then again,
most newer software need 7.x. System 6.0.5 is the first to support MacTCP
2.0.6, MacPPP 2.0.1 and TrueType 1.0. Many prefer 6.0.5, but 6.0.7 or 6.0.8
can run a few more things (Text to Speech, Sound Manger, AOL 2.7, some
games and control panels, for example).

System 6.0.7 may be the stablest 6.x and it uses System 6 printing
software. Actually, if you install the Style Writer (you can use a SW I or
SW II with System 6) you get updated to System 7 printing software anyway.
System 6.0.8 is otherwise identical to 6.0.7 but it comes with System 7
printing software which saves time loading drivers back and forth if you
are sharing a laser printer on a network of both System 6 and 7 macs. If
you use a laser printer on a System 6-only network (or a single mac) then
it is faster to use System 6 printing software that comes with 6.0.7 and
earlier.

System 6.0.8L is a special version for Classic, Classic II, PowerBook 100,
LC and LC II (although also 6.0.5 seems to work on a PowerBook 100).

* The last freely distributed System 7.5.3rev2 (this file includes System
7.5 Update 2.0 and System 7.5.3 Revision 2) and the updater to System
7.5.5. System 7.5.3rev2 is available as 19 parts of self-mounting Disk Copy
images. Download all 19 parts to your hard drive and then double-click on
the first part to mount the compressed disk image on your desktop (this
takes a while on a 68000 mac!). Note that System 7.5.3 installer's
self-mounting disk images require System 7.0.1 or later. If you are using a
version of Mac OS prior to this, you can download System 7.0.1's Disk Tools
floppy or System 7.5 Network Access floppy disk and boot your Macintosh
from them to use this software (if your mac boots from 7.0.1 or 7.5).

Q: How to make a System 7.5 emergency boot floppy?
A: Substitute the Finder in "Network Access" disk with MiniSubstitute's
Finder (68K version). Now there is also room for a harddrive formatter like
Apple HD SC Setup 7.3.5 and Disk First Aid 7.2.2 (launch them via
File/Open...). To make a System 7.5 anti-virus boot floppy, delete
everything except System and MiniSubstitute's Finder to make room for
Disinfectant 3.7.1 (Disinfectant 3.7.1 is obsolete, but nevertheless the
last anti-virus utility for 68000 macs).

* System 7.0* (DD floppies) and 7.0.1*; remember to also get the 7.0.x
tune-up because it prevents data corruption! (Note that although the DD
floppy version's "Install 1" floppy boots with 7.0, the "Disk Tools" floppy
boots with 6.0.7).

System 6.0.8L is a special version for Classic, Classic II, PowerBook 100,
LC and LC II. Note that after you have created floppies from these disk
images with Disk Copy 6.x, you have to delete "6.0.8L " from both floppies'
names in order to get the Installer script to recognize them.

* If you don't yet have a bootable mac disk but instead have a working (!)
PC, you can make a bootable System 7.5 or 6.0.8 mac 1.4MB floppy on a PC:
Decode and expand Network Access Disk 7.5 or System 6.0.8 image with
Aladdin Expander-win and write it to a HD floppy using WinImage - this disk
boots a SuperDrive-equipped mac if it supports System 7.5 or 6.0.8.
(WinImage doesn't seem to support self mounting image files (.smi), only
"plain" Disk Copy 4.2 format images so this trick doesn't work with all
System files on the net).

* Q: How to upgrade from System 6 to System 7 if I don't _already_ have
System 7.0.1* boot disks?

A: You can download System 7.0*, 7.0.1* and 7.5.5 from Apple. However,
Apple sites now store these as .smi images that can't be opened in System 6
(or 7.0)! It was not a smart move from Apple to transfer these System 7.0.*
images from System 6-compatible Disk Copy 4.2 format to .smi which requires
System 7.0.1... But wait, there is a solution:

1. If possible, use another mac running System 7.0.1 and up to decode .smi
images to System 6-compatible Disk Copy 4.2 format (and write the disk
images back to floppies).

If using a lone System 6 mac:

2. Download System 7.0* or 7.0.1* from other sites that have them in Disk
Copy 4.2 format.

<http://home.earthlink.net/~gamba2/syslist.html>

List of boot disk download sites:

<http://home.earthlink.net/~gamba2/bootdisks.html>

This site has System 7.5.3 Disk Tools disks for 68k and PPC macs:

<ftp://ftp.uottawa.ca/pub/uo-net/mac/english/apple/disktools/>

3. Get System 7.0.1 squeezed on 800K floppy and decode System 7.0 or 7.0.1
.smi files running it (big finder version for the Plus and the SE, the
mini-finder versions can't mount disk images):

<http://home.earthlink.net/~gamba2/bootdisks.html>

* If you want to have multiple System Folders on one disk, use System
Picker to select the "blessed" System which boots the mac. Note that if you
boot into System 7 after using previous Systems, the Desktop file is always
rebuilt unless "Desktop Mgr" is installed in pre-7 Systems (Desktop Mgr was
part of AppleShare 2.0.1 and Oscar).

<ftp://ftp.info.apple.com//devworld/Utilities/System_Picker_1.1a3.sit.hqx>
<ftp://ftp.funet.fi//pub/mac/comm/oscar.sit>

* Be aware that if you put an unlocked System 6.x disk (the same apparently
applies to pre-6 Systems also) to a mac running System 8.x, this
"unblesses" the System 6.x disk making it unbootable. You can rebless it by
booting to System 6.x or 7.x and opening & closing the unblessed System
Folder - the blessed System Folder should now have the System icon on it.
...so have at least two _locked_ bootable System disks or .image files in a
safe place!

* Q: How to add keyboard layouts?
A: Info-mac has some localized keyboard layouts. With System 6, open the
System file and the KCHR resource within it with ResEdit. Open the keyboard
layout you want to add and the KCHR resource within it as another window.
Copy and paste the KCHR layout to the System file's KCHR resource list and
save changes. Select the layout from the Keyboard Control Panel. With
System 7 and up you can just drag 'n drop the layout on top of the System
Folder.

Macintosh/Utilities/ResEdit_2.1.3.sea.hqx>

* Note that the Plus and some older SE's don't have a SuperDrive (i.e.
1.44MB HD floppy drive) so you can only use 800K DD floppies on them (you
can't use PC-formatted floppies with these old macs).
Tip 1: ShrinkWrap and Disk Copy 6.x allow you to mount .image files as
virtual disks on your desktop; this enables macs without SuperDrives to
access virtual HD floppies and install software from them (you can transfer
the disk image to the mac via network, compressed and split on multiple DD
floppies etc). If you have PC Exchange installed, you can also mount
PC-formatted images this way!
Tip 2: You can make a boot-up floppy including AppleShare and connect to
AppleTalk network; this allows CD-ROMless macs to install system software
from another mac's CD-ROM drive etc.

If you are using System 6 you can mount and create disk images with Steve
Christensen's MountImage 1.2b2. Unfortunately, MountImage has a serious bug
that can cause data corruption if the original image file is split into
more than three fragments when stored on disk. In this case, MountImage can
lose track of some data fragments, blindly reading and writing to blocks
that may not belong to the image file, which can overwrite and damage other
files on your drive. Use of MountImage is _highly_ discouraged, even by
Steve. So with System 7.0.1 and up use Disk Copy 6.x or ShrinkWrap.

 ...QueComp (tel: 612-623-0903) should have out-of-business Applied
Engineering AEHD+ Drives for $99 (you may find one cheaper from flea
markets or user groups). Resurrect your old Plus or SE that does not have a
SuperDrive without having to replace the board in the computer (impossible
on the Plus; expensive on the SE). AE made three external floppy disk
drives for Macintosh and Apple II computers: 1. AEHD+ Drive - SuperDrive
Compatibility for the Mac Plus, SE and II. 2. AEHD 3.5" Drive - 1.44MB
Drive for SuperDrive Equipped Macs. 3. AE 3.5" 800K Drive - 800K Drive for
Macintosh and Apple II Computers.
The AE HD+ can read/write/format 1.4MB floppies on 800K floppy based
compact Macs. The Mac II requires an optional (not included) AE floppy
interface to use the AE HD+, since the Mac II case does not have a built-in
external floppy connector. A major drawback is that the AE HD+ cannot be
the startup disk drive; not as a 1.4MB floppy and not even as a 800K
floppy. The other drawback is that you've got to have the AEHD+ extension
(takes 32K on disk) to use the drive even as a 800K floppy drive (i.e. you
must startup off another drive that contains the AEHD+ extension). AEHD+
extension is compatible at least with System 6.0.7 and 7.5.5.

There also used to be Drive 2.4 from Kennect Technology that plugged into
the floppy port of a MacPlus and allowed it to use 1.4MB disks. It could
also format them to a proprietary 2.4MB size.

Q: How can I get System from HD floppies to a DD-only mac like the Plus?
A1: Attach the Plus' external hard drive to another mac which has a HD
floppy drive. Boot the other mac - the external HD should appear on the
desktop. Do a _custom_ install of the desired System from the HD floppies
(i.e. install it for the Plus) on the external HD. Reattach the external HD
onto your Plus. (Shutdown the macs when connecting the SCSI-cables).
A2: Transfer the HD disk images to the Plus' harddisk via network,
compressed and split on multiple DD floppies etc. Boot with a System 6 or 7
floppy (see above for a source for System 7.0.1 squeezed on a 800K floppy).
Mount the HD System disk images with Mount Image 1.2b2 (System 6) or Shrink
Wrap (System 7) and install the System from them.

Q: How can I download files via a PC to a Plus or an older SE which don't
have a SuperDrive?
A1: The easiest solution is to download via a PC, put the files on a
PC-formatted floppy, copy the files to a newer Mac's hard disk and then to
a DD floppy that the Plus/SE can read. Get also StuffIt Expander 4.0.1 as
you need it to decode the files (don't decode them on a PC!). It is best to
use DD floppies on the Plus because HD floppies re-formatted as DD are not
reliable. (If you put a DD formatted HD floppy in a SuperDrive you must
cover the second hole to fool the SuperDrive into recognizing it as DD,
otherwise it will assume it is an unformatted HD floppy).
A2: Use an Iomega Zip drive or other removable media.
A3: If the Plus/SE is connected to the net it is also possible to email the
files as attachments or transfer them via ftp, zmodem etc.
A4: Get a Mac to PC null-modem cable, connect the serial ports and transfer
files using terminal programs. It is also possible to directly connect two
modems (thus bypassing the telephone company).

About MacPlus harddrives:
* MacPlus does not supply internal termination, so the SCSI chain (even one
external HD) has to be terminated at beginning and end; i.e.
MacPlus-terminator-HD-terminator.
* For best performance reformat the drive to 1:3 interleave if you mainly
use it on a Plus.
* Note that some SCSI drivers like APS Power Tools 2.8.2 (formerly
"Alliance Power Tools") don't always work on a Plus: As shipped, the SCSI
Manager 4.3 compliant driver will not permit the drive to be booted on a
Plus because the driver is too large to load into the Plus's memory
(causing a freeze early in the startup process). APT 2.8.2 automatically
senses the environment in which it is running. If it finds that it is
running on a Mac Plus, it will install version 5.3 of the NS-SCSI driver,
which is fully compatible with the Mac Plus and other Mac models; version
5.3, however, does NOT support SCSI Manager 4.3. If APT 2.8.2 finds itself
running on a Macintosh other than the Plus, it will assume that the SCSI
Manager 4.3 compliant driver is to be installed on the target drive. APT
2.8.2 can also "retrograde" your hard drive by installing the APT driver
version 5.3 and reconfiguring the driver partition, all without
reformatting the drive.
* If you use a Zip drive as a boot drive on a Plus you will need v4.2 Zip
drivers. Make sure that other Zip drives don't update the drivers
automatically.

Q: How to zap PRAM?
A: On System 6: Hold down Option-Command-Shift and select Control Panels
from the Apple menu. On System 7 and better: Boot with
Option-Command-P-R-keys pressed down until the mac beeps two times.

Tips using AppleTalk between macs:
* AppleTalk is built-in so you may not need to buy anything to get things
running via LocalTalk. Install System 7.0* or better from the installer
disks making sure you also check the FileSharing option. Then you can mount
shared volumes and folders between macs connected via a LocalTalk cable or
a cheaper and better Farallon PhoneNet cable. Also a simple ImageWriter
cable does just fine although you can connect only two macs using it.
(EtherTalk is just a driver which allows AppleTalk protocol to be
transported by Ethernet).
* Macs using System 6 can access shared items on newer Systems but if you
want to make them file-servers you have to buy AppleShare server software.
* Public Folder 1.01 allows also System 6 macs to be one-way file-servers:

minimum requirements for the net
--------------------------------

MacPlus, (2.5-)4MB RAM, 20MB harddisk, (2400-)14400 modem, System 7.0* and
MacTCP 2.0.6 are the practical minimum requirements for PPP connections.
Only MacPPP 2.0.1, v2.0.1cm4, v2.1.1SD and v2.1.2SD, MacSLIP 3.0.3,
InterSLIP 1.0.1 and FCRppp 1.6 currently work on 68000 macs.

You need MacTCP for TCP-connections like direct ethernet or PPP- and
SLIP-connection via modem. MacTCP is included in System 7.5 and above.
Apple dealers sell MacTCP but also "The Internet Starter Kit for Macintosh"
(Adam Engst, Hayden Books) book includes it, among other utilities. When
installing MacTCP, turn AppleTalk ON (Leaving it OFF seems to provoke a
crash when saving MacTCP prefs for the first time. With some Systems you
may have to reboot to make AppleTalk active) - to save memory, AppleTalk
can be turned OFF after the settings are stored.

<http://www.mcp.com/hayden/iskm/mac.html>

MacTCP can also be found on the net:

MacTCP 2.0.4:
<http://www.mdstud.chalmers.se/pub/internet/mac/MacTCP/MacTCP.hqx>

MacTCP 2.0.6 and some developer stuff:
<ftp://ftp.info.apple.com//devworld/Development_Kits/MacTCP.sit.hqx>

MacTCP 2.0.x to 2.0.6 updaters:
<ftp://ftp.info.apple.com//Apple.Support.Area/Apple.Software.Updates/US/
Macintosh/Networking-Communications/Other_N-C/MacTCP_2.0.6_Update.sea.hqx>
<ftp://ftp.funet.fi//pub/mac/info-mac/comm/inet/conn/mactcp-206-updt.hqx>

MacPPP 2.0.1, v2.0.1cm4, v2.1.1SD and v2.1.2SD:
<ftp://ftp.funet.fi//pub/mac/info-mac/comm/inet/conn/ppp/mac-ppp-201.hqx>
<ftp://ftp.unipg.it//pub/mac/tcpip/mac-ppp-201cm4.hqx>

<ftp://garbo.uwasa.fi//mac/internet/serial/macppp212sd.sit>

MacPPP 2.1.2SD is recommended as a first choice for System 7.x 68000 macs.
MacPPP 2.0.1cm4, v2.1.1SD and v2.1.2SD are enhanced versions of MacPPP
2.0.1; v2.0.1cm4 enables background dialing, for instance - MacPPP 2.1.2SD
has enhancements like: fixes problem with Config PPP not being able to
access it's prefs file if the Finder closed the control panel on a low
memory error, terminal window is larger and scrolling of text off the top
is a little cleaner, shows the 115K and 230K rates in the Port Speed popup
(and has 4800 as a slowest port speed vs 1200 on v2.0.1). (Note that MacPPP
2.0.1 variations fail to redraw the PPP "up" symbols on screen (after the
1st connection; no reboot between connections) unless you cover and uncover
them with other windows). If the "Open" button is grayed out in MacPPP make
sure that PPP is selected in MacTCP. Note that there is a memory related
bug in MacPPP 2.0.1: If applications have used all available memory, Config
PPP is forced to close with an error message like: "The control panel
"Config PPP" cannot be used now, because not enough memory is available."
It is not possible to reopen the control panel because there is a message:
"Config PPP Error! Opening Preferences". This prevents one from properly
closing the internet connection.

Commercial MacSLIP supports SLIP and PPP (requires at least System 6.0.7):

<http://www.zilker.net/~hydepark/>

InterSLIP 1.0.1:

<ftp://ftp.funet.fi//pub/mac/info-mac/comm/inet/conn/
inter-slip-installer-101.hqx>

LinkUPPP! (formerly FCRppp) supports PPP and SLIP. Commercial FCRppp 1.6
should work on 68000 macs (v1.1r1 doesn't work on a PB100):

Q: Do all modems work with 68000 macs?
A: For external (>9600) modems you need a mac hardware handshake cable. It
connects the DB25 connector on the modem to the mac's 8 pin modem port
connector. Some modems like Global Village Bronze get their power through
the ADB port which the Plus, 128K, 512K and 512Ke lack. There are some
modems that require a power pin, not available on a Plus. There are also
some limitations such as the the Plus not having incoming flow control.
This limits the speed you can set the serial port before you have a lot of
overruns. Some included software may also not work on 68000 macs eventhough
the modem may otherwise be OK.
 > Mike Friese: I have successfully interfaced a Global Village Teleport
Bronze II modem to a Mac Plus. I made a special keyboard cable that tapped
the +5 volt power from the Plus keyboard cable to a ADB connector (sold as
a S-video connector at Radio Shack.)
-Remove the keyboard cable from the Plus.
-Looking from the cord end of one of these connectors you will see the four
wires, yellow, green, red, black. Here's how the connector looks when
viewed from the cord end (use non-proportional font):
       ___
      |   |
  ____|   |____
 |             |
 | Yl Gn Rd Bk |
 |             |
 |_____________|
-Cut the outer insulating jacket about one inch from one of the two
connectors.
-Cut insulation from the yellow and black wires. Solder a two foot long red
wire to the keyboard cable's yellow wire. Solder a two foot long black wire
to the keyboard cable's black wire.
-Get a female mini-din (S-video) connector. Viewing from the solder end,
you'll notice the pins arranged in a trapezoid pattern.
  o  o
 
 o    o      (solder end view)
-Solder the red wire to the upper left pin. Solder the black wire to the
upper right pin
  r  b
 
 o    o      (solder end view)
-Insulate all your splices.
-Plug the keyboard cable in with the splices closest to the Mac Plus system
unit.
-Plug the Bronze II into the modem port and the other modem cable into the
s-video cable. You now have a snazzy-looking 2400 baud modem attached to
your Plus. But wait. There's more!
-The fax software bundled with the Performa will work with the Plus, but
the hot ticket is to use the fax software bundled with the Teleport
Platinum. This software is slick as can be. <

Q: What port speed should I be using with a modem?
A: Try first 19200 and increase it gradually; do some downloads with Fetch
to test the speed you're getting (with compressable .txt and uncompressable
.sit files) and check MacPPP's Stats window for the amount of CRC errors
and Hdw overruns after the connection. 8MHz 68000 macs (Plus, SE, Classic)
should handle 28800bps - there's some packet loss but it's more than made
up for by the extra speed compared to 19200 (note that some modems don't
support 28800 port speed). 16MHz macs (Portable, PB 100) should be fine at
38400-57600 although Global Village recommends 19200 for the PB100 &
PowerPort/Gold 14400 modem. Turning AppleTalk on/off shouldn't be a big
issue unless you're using your modem and moving a lot of data at the same
time via FileSharing.

Q: How can I connect slotless macs like the Plus to direct ethernet?
A: Farallon, Dayna and Asanté have ethernet adapters which connect to the
mac's SCSI port (Farallon EtherMac MicroSCSI, Dayna DaynaPORT Pocket
SCSI/Link & DaynaPORT SCSI/Link and Asanté Micro EN/SC & Desktop EN/SC).
Note that some of these SCSI ethernet adapters may not work because unlike
other macs the Plus doesn't supply current to the SCSI port. Note also that
SCSI ethernet adapters are quite expensive and slow. An alternative to SCSI
ethernet adapters is Farallon EtherMac adapter which connects via LocalTalk
port with speeds 5x over the standard 230.4Kbps LocalTalk rate. Although
EtherMac draws power from the ADB port, there is a power adapter for
non-ADB computers like the Plus. Another option is to connect to ethernet
via LocalTalk with a software (Apple LocalTalk Bridge and Farallon
PowerPath & LocalPath) or hardware bridge (Farallon, Dayna and Asanté).

On 68000 macs telnet-, ftp-, mail-, news- and tcp-apps like NCSA Telnet,
Fetch, Anarchie 1.6.0, Eudora, NewsWatcher and MacTCP Watcher 1.1.2 work
fine. Eudora Light 3.1 has many additional features like filters and it
also no longer splits large messages; it is somewhat slower than v1.5.5.
With MacPlus you can't use control-keys in NCSA Telnet (in ZTerm you can
use option or command instead of control).

MacSOUP 2.4 is an off-line newsreader that runs on a 4MB mac with System
7.0.1* but it really needs at least a 8MB mac to be usable. Note also that
some ISPs' news servers may have too many newsgroups to fit into
NewsWatcher's memory (even after its memory allocation is increased via
File/Get Info dialog), so that it may refuse to run on low-memory macs. If
this happens, you may telnet into your ISP's shell account and use UNIX tin
newsreader.

On 68000 macs NCSA Mosaic 1.0.3, MacWeb 1.00A3.2, v2.0, MacLynx and MacWWW
1.03 (Samba) work.

MacWeb 1.00A3.2 works better than v1.1.1 E which crashes when saving prefs.
MacWeb 2.0 has more features and understands more HTML tags than v1.00A3.2
but it is also slower and buggier. NCSA Mosaic 1.0.3 can display in-line
GIFs but with MacWeb you must use an external helper (click and hold on an
image icon, choose "Retrieve to Disk" from the pop-up menu and view with
GIFConverter or GIFwatcher DA). ...note that often GIFConverter, when
trying to open JPEGs with "millions" of colors, gives an "out of memory"
error on low-memory machines. A workround is to use JPEG Convert 1.0 to
turn the JPEG into a GIF. GIFs are limited to 256 colours and need less
memory to display. You can turn DAs like GIFwatcher DA into an app with DA
Piggyback; this enables drag 'n drop and automatic launching when used as a
(MacWeb 2.0) helper on System 7. Note that you can't change GIFwatcher's
default settings (including the window size) once the DA has been converted
into an app - you have to set it up the way you want first, then run it
through DA PiggyBack. With RAM Charger it is possible to squeeze _both_
MacWeb 1.00A3.2 and GIFConverter to run simultaneously on a 4MB mac.

Q: How do I cancel an action in MacWeb 1.00A3.2?
A: Type command-period (many other programs use this as a standard, too).

If the default screen in MacLynx is too big it is possible to open lynx.cfg
file by a text editor and set the lines on a screen from the default 35 to
24, for example (edit the line: TERM_LINES:35 to: TERM_LINES:24). The home
page (or sometimes called the menu page) from Internet Config can be
invoked with the 'm' key. The homepage can be set by editing the line:
STARTFILE:file://localhost/~/index.html; change it to any valid URL. There
are many more options in lynx.cfg file.

"ftp;http://proxy.utas.edu.au:8080/".
* Setting no proxy: 1. Using ResEdit, open MacWeb 1.00A3.2. 2. Open 'STR#'
"NoProxy Info" ID=804. 3. Create a string for each server for which proxy
support is not wanted. "*" may be used as a wildcard for every server in a

List of small www-browser download sites:

With only 1MB RAM, floppy drive(s) and System 6 you can connect via a
terminal emulator like ZTerm and use unix apps like pine, tin, ftp, ncftp,
sz, rz, and lynx for mail, news, file transfer and www. With ZTerm you can
use option or command instead of control when using MacPlus. To save disk
space on those 800K floppies install the minimum System 6.0.x that ZTerm
requires. You can trash all files except System and Finder, delete
unnecessary fonts and DAs from the System file with Font/DA Mover and
delete PPC code from ZTerm with Strip Fat to save even more disk space.

<ftp://ftp.funet.fi//pub/mac/info-mac/comm/term/zterm-10b3.hqx>

If you want to use System 6 and connect via PPP, following software
versions work even with 1MB RAM: System 6.0.5-6.0.8 (MacPPP 2.0.1 insists
that System Folder's name must be "System Folder" so if you are using a
localized System change the folder's name accordingly), MacTCP 2.0.6,
MacPPP 2.0.1 (later versions like v2.1.2SD crash), NCSA Telnet 2.6 or
v2.7b4, Fetch 3.0.3, Eudora 1.3.1 (install also Map control panel from the
System disks and set your time zone), NewsWatcher 2.0d13m01, Internews 1.1,
MacWWW 1.03 (Samba), MacTCP Watcher 1.1.2 (older versions of these apps may
use less memory).
MacWWW 1.03 (Samba) works on 68000 macs (at least on System 6.0.5 - it
crashes on System 7.0.1*). It opens fine, loads the startup page fine
(doesn't know how to read files from disk, text-only, no ISO 8859-1
translation, opens a new window for each link). Do not close any windows as
this crashes the mac; also quitting MacWWW seems to cause a crash. To save
space on a floppy-only system, install a minimum System for your mac and
delete all System Folder items except System, Finder, PPP, ConfigPPP,
MacTCP, PPP Preferences, MacTCP DNR and MacTCP Prep; delete also
unnecessary fonts and DAs from the System file with Font/DA Mover (keep
Control Panel DA, though) - this leaves 322K of free space on a DD floppy
with System 6.0.5 US (MacPlus minimum install). Unfatten also "fat"
tcp-apps. Turn RAM Cache off to leave maximum amount of RAM to the apps.

misc info
---------

* Use Command-X-O to boot the Classic from its ROM.

* If you need to save disk space unfatten "fat" apps with Strip Fat, for
example:

<ftp://ftp.funet.fi//pub/mac/info-mac/cfg/strip-fat.hqx>

* RAM Charger <http://www.syncronys.com/> works also on 68000 macs on
System 7. It makes apps run in less memory than they normally demand, only
giving them more if they need it. Highly recommended! There is a one-week
fully functional demo at:

<ftp://ftp.pgh.net/pub/jumpdev/Old/RAMCharger301Demo.hqx>
<ftp://ftp.pgh.net/pub/jumpdev/Old/RAMChargerReference.sit.hqx>

* Nisus Compact 3.474c word processor is available for free download. Also
Nisus Writer 4.1.6 is freely downloadable: on a 4MB PB100 running 7.0.1* it
can be launched OK (it takes all 3000K free memory) but it seems to
repeatedly crash when switching to Finder or if documents are opened, so it
doesn't really seem too compatible with this configuration although it has
a good reputation on newer macs. So use Nisus Compact 3.474c which runs OK
on 68000 macs.

<http://www.ou.nl/open/psl/pb100/#resources>

* Remote control program Timbuktu Pro 1.0.3 works on 68000 macs and it
seems to also work on newer macs such as PowerMacintosh 8600/200 with
System 8.1.

Although the performance is acceptable even via the slow LocalTalk cabling
(AppleTalk), it is advisable to set a newer mac's monitor to display the
minimum amount shades of gray and turn off any desktop pictures to speed
things up.

It is rather awesome to run PPC applications via a 68000 mac although the 1
bit screen doesn't dither color/grayscale images very well.

There was/is a 1 week trial version. Notice that you must do a Custom
Install with System 8.1 because Easy Install mode doesn't work. Later
versions like 2.0.5 don't work on 68000 macs.

* To invoke ImageWriter II's bi-directional printing in the "Faster" print
mode hold the Option-Shift-Caps Lock keys while hitting the "OK" button in
the Print dialog. This bi-directional printing, which does cause some loss
in print quality, will remain in effect until the printer is reset, or you
hold down the Command key while hitting the "OK" button for the next
printing task.

* Q: How to open compact macs like the Plus?
A: (If you don't know what you're doing, don't do this!) The usual
mail-order companies may still have "Mac Cracker" kits, eventhough they
don't put them in the catalogue anymore. It's a very long 3/16" allen (hex)
wrench, otherwise known as a Torx T-15. Lay the mac down on its "face",
with the screen on a soft pad or pillow. After removing ALL the (5) TORX
screws, take off the plastic reset switch (if you have one) from the
left-hand side and work your fingers into the crack in the case, all the
way around, at least twice. Then try lifting the case up and giving it a
gentle shake. The case should slide off and the mac will drop into the
pillow. If not, go around the case again with your fingers and try again.
You need strong fingernails and lots of patience. Do NOT use a screwdriver
- you'll scar the case. If a Mac hasn't been opened before, it could be
pretty tight.

Chuck's Tools online have long T-15 Torx drivers specifically for Classic

* Q: When was my serial# "xx631xx" MacPlus made?
A: The important digits to figure out are the 3rd, 4th and 5th. The 3rd
digit is the last digit of the year (will be 5 through 9 or 0), in this
case 6 is for 1986. The 4th and 5th are the week of the year (will be 01
through 52), in this case the 31st week of the year. So yours was made the
first week of July, 1986.
