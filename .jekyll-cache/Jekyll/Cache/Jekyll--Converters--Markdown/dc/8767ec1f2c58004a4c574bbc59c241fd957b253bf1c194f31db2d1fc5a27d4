I"Ÿ=<p><img src="/mac/powermac6100/img/09macos.gif" alt="Logo" /> This page describes some of the operating systems that can run on the Power Mac 6100 series.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Despite its positioning as a single-OS machine, the Power Mac 6100 series is actually capable of running several different operating systems. Which one you choose is primarily a function of your intended use for the machine and your level of intellectual curiosity. There‚Äôs far too much to operating systems for me to discuss intelligently here, so all I can do is whet your appetite.</p>

<h3 id="the-mac-os">The Mac OS</h3>

<p>I have no empirical data, but I‚Äôd feel pretty safe saying that 99% of Power Mac 6100‚Äôs out there are running some version of the venerable Mac OS. Even though it‚Äôs 15 years old and full ‚Äòo bugs, we love it, warts and all. It gets better with every revision, and it‚Äôs still better than Windows!</p>

<p>The 6100 series can run anything from System 7.1.2 all the way up to Mac OS 9.04. Each new version fixes some bugs, creates new bugs, adds some features, and eats more RAM. So choose wisely. Not everyone needs to upgrade to the latest and greatest just because it‚Äôs available. The following is a summary of the various versions. Note that, between 7.5 and 7.6, the numbering scheme was pretty darn bizarre, due to the ever-changing strategy and the enormous complications resulting from a change in processor families (from 680x0 to PowerPC) and a change in architecture (from Nubus to PCI).</p>

<p>The following lists some of the features of the different OS versions.</p>

At the initial price of $99, 8.0 also kicked off the modern business model for Apple‚Äôs OS group. Prior to 8.0, I don‚Äôt believe Apple viewed the retail OS as an important source of revenue. The strong response to 8.0 upgrades triggered a renewed interest in developing the OS specifically for the upgrade market. I believe we owe the continued support of legacy machines to market success of this release.</td>

<h3 id="mac-os-x">Mac OS X</h3>

<p>Mac OS X is the next big thing for the Mac. A fusion of Apple and NeXT technology, OS X is fully native, fully pre-emptive, fully protected and full of the bells, whistles and buzzwords we‚Äôve been promised since PowerPC first appeared. It supports symmetric multiprocessing, to go along with the multi-G4 machines shipping now and the multi-core CPU‚Äôs currently under development.</p>

<p>OS X supports several different application models‚Äìthe legacy Mac OS (aka Blue Box, Classic), a buzzword-compliant (and semi-backward-compatible) update of the Mac OS (Carbon), the NeXT-derived APIs (aka OPENSTOP, Rhapsody, Yellow Box, Cocoa), and Java. Although not heavily marketed as such, OS X is BSD underneath, so a great deal of BSD/*nix utilities and applications should survive a recompile or a quick port.</p>

<p>A nifty new UI (Aqua) on top of a brand new imaging model (PDF-based Quartz) plus OpenGL and QuickTime will provide the eye-candy. Although heavily optimized for the Mac hardware and heavily customized for the Mac market, what‚Äôs under the hood of OS X is fundamentally Unix‚Äìthat time-worn and battle-tested rat‚Äôs nest of hacker‚Äôs delight that has powered much of enterprise computing for the last several decades. (More specifically, it is the aforementioned APIs sitting on top of BSD 4.4 on top of a heavily customized, open-source Mach 3.0 microkernel (Darwin). It should be POSIX-compliant, although not certified as such, and many BSD applications will allegedly run with a recompile)</p>

<p>Early results from OS X are very promising. Compatibility seems good, application-level performance seems pretty good, even for legacy applications, and Apple seems to be doing a great job of hiding Unix from the user. <FLAMEBAIT>If Apple can really pull off OS X, it will have for the first time since Windows 95 was released, a truly superior OS with no compromises on features, performance, resource efficiency or stability.</FLAMEBAIT></p>

<p>Sadly, Mac OS X probably will not run on a 6100, no matter what you do to the hardware. There is a very remote possibility that this machine might work someday, but it won‚Äôt be with the inital release of OS X, and it certainly won‚Äôt be supported by Apple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The remote possibility exists at all because of the Darwin project. The Mach kernel underlying OS X is open-source, and it already runs natively on the 6100. In fact, Apple co-developed a Linux variant, MkLinux, that runs atop the Mach microkernel.</li>
  <li>Darwin is the name for Apple‚Äôs modified, open-source-ish version of the kernel, and it‚Äôs attracting the attention of such industry luminaries as id Software founder and alpha-geek John Carmack. Carmack is an avowed fan of NeXT/OPENStep, and has been very influential in Apple‚Äôs adoption of OpenGL and in their broader approach to the gaming market. Carmack‚Äôs primary strategic goal is getting rid of the hockey-puck mouse, but in the meantime he‚Äôs hacking away at getting the X-window system running on OS X.</li>
  <li>Kernel support isn‚Äôt enough, though. The 6100/7100/8100 run on a fundamentally different architecture than all later (PCI) Macs. In order to provide support for these machines someone would have to rewrite a bunch of device drivers. Apple isn‚Äôt likely to do this for a six-year-old machine, but someone else might. If enough of the operating system is open-sourced via the Darwin project, it is conceivable that OS X might one day run on the 6100.</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt hold your breath.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="virtualpc">VirtualPC</h3>

<p>Using VirtualPC from Connectix, you can actually run DOS, Windows, WinNT, OPENStep or OS/2 on your Mac! If you attempt to run VirtualPC on a stock 6100, you will be sorely disappointed. Emulation requires a lot of horsepower. Even with my Newer210 card, Windows 95 under VirtualPC is about as fast as a 66 MHz 486. Fast enough to make it usable, but I wouldn‚Äôt try to play Quake on it.</p>

<h3 id="linux">Linux</h3>

<p>By now, everyone‚Äôs heard of Linux, the free and open-sourced Unix clone that‚Äôs sweeping geekdom as we speak. Among the many touted strengths of Linux is it‚Äôs comparatively low resource requirements and its support for obsolete hardware. So is the 6100 a candidate?</p>

<p>Yup. The 6100 can run a variant of Linux called MkLinux (pronounced ‚Äúem-kay‚Äù for the micro-kernel). Apple was developing MkLinux in conjunction with the Open Software Foundation, and funded development through Developer Release 3, which is freely available from Apple‚Äôs website. Other resources include www.mklinux.org which distibures the most recent kernel builds beyond DR3. You can also buy the CD and documentation from Prime Time Freeware.</p>

<p>MkLinux can work in conjunction with a G3 upgrade card, which is great, since the X Window system really crawls on a stock machine. Installation is a bit tricky with the G3 card, though, so I will quote some excellent instructions from Danny Lonborg:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have a 6100 with the 240 MHz Newer card, and MkLinux works fine with it. The trick is to get the G3 card driver to load before the MkLinux booter. Here‚Äôs what I did:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Change the type of the MkLinux Booter extension from ‚Äòscri‚Äô to ‚ÄòINIT‚Äô using ResEdit or the like, so that it loads with the rest of the extensions instead of before them.</li>
    <li>Add a few spaces to the beginning of the MkLinux Booter extension so that it comes alphabetically just after the MAXPower G3 PDS extension.</li>
    <li>The MkLinux Booter fails if it can‚Äôt find the file ‚ÄúMkLinux Booter‚Äù in your extension folder. Make a copy of the newly-renamed-and-retyped MkLinux Booter, title it ‚ÄúMkLinux Booter‚Äù, and change its type to ‚Äú????‚Äù so it won‚Äôt load as an extension.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>On a related note, the clock (I‚Äôm talking time-of-day here, not the processor clock :) is really slow under Linux since I installed the G3 card. I lose about 20 minutes on the hour. Any ideas? I tried changing mach_kernel/ppc/model_dep.c to convince the kernel that it‚Äôs really a PDM machine, even though the processor is a 750, but I couldn‚Äôt get that kernel to boot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Following his instructions, I have successfully installed and run MkLinux DR3 on my 6100/Newer 210. It runs fine, although I‚Äôm not very Linux-savvy and can do precious little with it.</p>

<p>There is another major variant of Linux for the Mac, and that‚Äôs LinuxPPC. This is a much more mature and supported platform, and support for the 6100 is in development. There is a budding movement spearheaded by Takashi to patch the LinuxPPC kernel for the Nubus PowerMac family (of which the 6100 is a member). Device support is being added, and the Takashi and the gang appear to be very active, as evidenced by the 151 messages on the mailing list during June 2001. They‚Äôre even working on enabling the Newer G3 card.</p>

<p>Takeshi has an old 6100 to play with, but he doesn‚Äôt have G3 card. So if anyone out there has a Newer or Sonnet card gathering dust, consider donating it to the cause :)</p>
