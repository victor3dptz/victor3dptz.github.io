<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>What does all this mean? The results of this extremely un-scientific experiment (sample size of 1) suggest the following. Itâ€™s been more than three years since I first wrote this page, and I need to update it with some current information. But here it is the way itâ€™s always been:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The stock 6100/60 exhibits really slow graphics performance.</li>
  <li>A 256K level 2 cache provides the best bang for the buck at $9. In addition to accelerating graphic performance as well as an HPV card, it also accelerates just about everything else your computer does. Every Power Mac should have one.</li>
  <li>While it doesnâ€™t include any QuickDraw acceleration, the HPV card is still significantly faster than the built-in DRAM video. Furthermore, you get more colors and the option to add a second monitor. For $200, I believe this is a great value over any of the Nubus-based solutions out there.</li>
  <li>Benchmarks and numbers aside, adding one or both of the above will result in your machine feeling zippier. Itâ€™s hard to describe, but youâ€™ll just feel better about your machine.</li>
  <li>A clock-accelerator can really crank your machine up to a new level, but it can be a bit risky. See my notes above.</li>
  <li>I donâ€™t know anything about Nubus video cards, except that youâ€™ll need a PDS-Nubus adapter in order to use one. If anyone out thereâ€™s got data on these, please let me know!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="feedback">Feedback</h3>

<p>If you disagree with the results Iâ€™ve listed here, or (better!), if youâ€™ve got results from a test using a Nubus video card (such as a 7 Rasterops 24XP [?]), please send them to me and Iâ€™ll plant them on the page.</p>

<p>The party line from some vendors is that speed increases dramatically with the installation of a 256K cache, but that increases beyond this level for larger (512K or 1MB) caches are very small. But other manufacturers, such as the L2 Company highly recommends larger caches.</p>

<p>Feedback Iâ€™ve received so far includes some from a fellow with a 1 MB Level 2 cache, who says that at 640x480/8 bit, the entire video page can be cached, resulting in very fast text scrolling that outperforms the HPV card. I canâ€™t duplicate his results, since I donâ€™t have a 1MB cache, but it certainly sounds logical. Of course if your goals also include increased bit depth, then youâ€™ll have to go with a video card.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve also heard scuttlebutt that clock-chipping is not dangerous to your CPU at all. The logic here goes: the CPU will stop working properly and the computer will crash long before the chip gets hot enough to get damaged. Of course, Iâ€™ve also heard stories of people whose clock-chipped computers have failed. Permanently. Caveat emptor. So far my email reads 6 no- problemâ€™s, 2 I-fried-my-motherboardâ€™s, and 2 Iâ€™m-scared-now-so-Iâ€™m-not-going-to-buy-oneâ€™s.</p>

<p>It definitely gets hot under the hood with all that additional hardware dissipating heat and blocking airflow. I got email from one guy whose clock-chipped 6100/DOS got so hot that he sawed holes in the case to ventilate it. If that sounds bizarre, I also got email from a guy who made a Frankensteinâ€™s Mac out of 6100 guts and a briefcase. So itâ€™d be portable. (He wanted to drive two monitors, so a PowerBook would not have worked.)</p>

<p>Well, thatâ€™s all for now.</p>
