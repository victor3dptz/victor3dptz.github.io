I":<h3 id="my-system">My system</h3>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: I purchased a Centris 610 motherboard on eBay to replace my non-ethernet board and I noticed it had a full 68040 33mhz chip (though runs at 20). I put together a complete system with 52mb RAM, 250mb HD, 230mb HD, and an Apple 14‚Äù monitor and installed A/UX with no trouble. I also had a PPC 601 upgrade card but I removed it because it generates quite a bit of heat even when not in use. Read the ‚Äúhow to install‚Äù section for info on 68040 systems and A/UX. I will also add new screenshots soon.</p>

<p>For this experiment, I went with a Macintosh IIci (25mhz 68030) with 20mb RAM, a 250mb SCSI HD, and an external Apple CD 600 (2x). The IIci also has a cache card. For video, I use an Apple 13‚Äù RGB display on the onboard port.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-install-aux">How to install A/UX</h3>

<p>this document will describe the process of installing Apple‚Äôs A/UX operating system. to do this, you will need a computer with a cd-recorder, the cdrecord application (or toast for macs), and a 68k macintosh equipped with at least 16mb ram, an 80mb hd, and a cdrom.</p>

<h3 id="to-burn-the-cd">To burn the CD</h3>

<p>In Windows - download the gzipped cd image from higher intellect (hotline://preterhuman.net). download cdrtools from somewhere. extract the cd image to the cdrtools folder. open a DOS window and run ‚Äúcdrecord.exe ‚Äìscanbus‚Äù. find the three numbers representing your cd burner. insert a blank cd into the recorder and run ‚Äúcdrecord.exe dev=(insert three numbers) imagename‚Äù. an example for my system is ‚Äúcdrecord.exe dev=1,0,0 AUX_30~1.IMA‚Äù</p>

<p>In MacOS - download and extract the cd image. launch toast and burn the cd image.</p>

<p>In Linux - use the cdrecord command syntax as seen in the windows instructions (untested as i have never burned a cd in linux)</p>

<h3 id="to-boot-aux">To boot A/UX</h3>

<p>Download the install floppy image from higher intellect and either rawrite it (in windows), dd it (in linux), or diskcopy it (in macos) to a 1.44mb floppy. now turn on your mac, insert the boot floppy and the A/UX cd. it should boot into the installer script.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE FOR 68040 USERS</strong>: you will need a system enabler file on the boot disk. If you use a Quadra or Centris that uses the System Enabler 040 then your system should work. Systems that use the 065 enabler might not (I put a full 68040 in an LC 475 and A/UX wouldn‚Äôt work). Enablers are available at the <a href="ftp://ftp.apple.com/">Apple FTP</a> site.</p>

<h3 id="to-install-aux">To install A/UX</h3>

<p>Use the buttons to select which drive to install to. then customize the to-be installed software list to match your needs. after you are done, the installation process begins. after the install you should have a bootable copy of A/UX on your hd. NOTE FOR 68040 USERS: if you successfully booted to the install program then your system should work fine, as it has already loaded the A/UX kernel for installation. If your screen goes blank during the A/UX loading phase and stops responding, your machine is incompatible.</p>

<p>I am currently writing a complete newbie guide to building an A/UX machine and getting standard tools working like gcc, httpd, and TCP/IP networking.</p>
